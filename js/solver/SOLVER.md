# Solver Search — Logic Flow

This document describes the abstract logic of the WynnSolver search pipeline, from user click to ranked results. The code spans three files: `solver_search.js` (main thread orchestration), `solver_worker.js` (per-worker DFS), and `solver_worker_shims.js` (DOM-free utility copies).

## Step 1 — Snapshot (`_build_solver_snapshot`)

Before spawning any workers the main thread reads every piece of mutable state that influences scoring and freezes it into a plain-object snapshot. This avoids race conditions if the user edits fields during a search.

Key pieces captured:
- **Weapon** and **level** — from solver item input nodes.
- **Tomes** and **guild tome** — from solver tome input nodes; guild tome determines the SP budget (200 / 204 / 205).
- **Atree state** — `atree_raw` (raw stat bonuses from the tree), `atree_merged` (full ability tree), and serialized `button_states` / `slider_states` (toggle/slider DOM state flattened to plain Maps so workers can clone them).
- **Static boosts** — merged from the Active Boosts panel.
- **Radiance boost** — floating multiplier (1.0–1.3) based on Radiance / Divine Honor toggles.
- **Parsed combo** — the ordered list of `{qty, spell, boost_tokens, dmg_excl, mana_excl}` rows. `dmg_excl` skips the row in damage scoring; `mana_excl` skips it in mana cost calculation. Powder-special spells are synthesised and inserted here.
- **Boost registry** — built from `build_combo_boost_registry`; maps boost token names to their stat/prop contributions.
- **Scoring target** — from `#solver-target` dropdown: `combo_damage` (default), `ehp`, `total_healing`, `spd`, `poison`, `lb`, `xpb`.
- **Mana constraint** — `combo_time` (seconds) and `allow_downtime` flag; used at the leaf to reject builds whose mana budget doesn't sustain the combo.
- **Restrictions** — from `get_restrictions()`: level range, build direction (which SP types are used), no-major-ID flag, stat thresholds.

---

## Step 2 — Item Pool Building (`_build_item_pools`)

For each free slot (helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots, ring, bracelet, necklace) the main thread filters `itemMap` to a candidate pool:

1. **Level range** — `lvl_min ≤ item.lvl ≤ lvl_max`.
2. **Major-ID filter** — if "No Major ID" is on, items with any major ID are excluded.
3. **Build direction** — if a SP type is disabled (e.g. Dexterity off), items that *require* that SP type are excluded.
4. **Roll mode** — each item's `maxRolls` are adjusted by the selected roll mode (Max / 75% / Avg / Min) before the Item object is created; the pool is thus pre-baked.
5. **Illegal sets** — sets whose 2-piece bonus has `illegal: true` (e.g. Morph) are tracked so the DFS can reject combinations containing two different items from the same such set.
6. A **NONE item** is prepended to every pool so "leave slot empty" is a valid candidate.

Locked slots (items the user pinned manually) are collected separately and removed from the pools — they do not vary during search.

---

## Step 3 — Dominance Pruning (`_prune_dominated_items`)

After the pools are built, each pool is scanned for dominated items. Item B is dominated by item A when A is a strictly-at-least-as-good drop-in replacement in any build:

1. **Scoring stats** — for every stat in `_build_dmg_weights` (and any `ge` stat-threshold stats): `A.stat ≥ B.stat`.
2. **SP requirements** — `A.reqs[i] ≤ B.reqs[i]` for all five attributes (A is at least as easy to equip).
3. **SP provisions** — `A.skillpoints[i] ≥ B.skillpoints[i]` for all five attributes (A grants at least as much SP).

Any build containing B can substitute A and achieve an equal or better score. B is therefore removed from the pool permanently.

**NONE items are never pruned.** Set-bonus interactions are not modelled (an item in set X could theoretically be rescued by a set bonus), so this is an approximation — but removing obvious dominatees typically reduces pool sizes by 20–40% without meaningful loss of result quality.

Dominance pruning runs in O(n² × |check\_stats|) per pool on the main thread before workers are spawned, adding only a few milliseconds of setup time.

---

## Step 4 — Work Partitioning (`_partition_work`)

The search space is split into fine-grained partitions (4× the worker count) to enable **work-stealing**: idle workers pick up partitions that slower workers haven't started yet.

Partition strategy (first applicable wins):

| Situation | Partition target | Balance method |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Both rings free | Outer ring index `i` (inner `j` iterates `i..N`) | Triangular load balancing (each outer step covers `N−i` inner steps) |
| One ring free | Ring pool sliced evenly | Equal-chunk slicing |
| No free rings | Largest free armor/accessory pool | Equal-chunk slicing |

Each partition descriptor is `{type, slot?, start, end}`.

---

## Step 5 — Worker Protocol

### Init message (main → worker, once per worker)
Heavy structured-clone payload: serialized pools, locked items, weapon statMap, tome statMaps, guild tome statMap, atree state, combo rows, boost registry, sets data, scoring target, combo time/downtime settings, etc. The first partition is embedded directly so the worker starts immediately on receipt.

### Run message (main → worker, subsequent partitions)
Lightweight: just `{type:'run', partition, worker_id}`. The worker reuses the already-stored `_cfg` for all heavy data, only updating which slice of a pool to search.

### Progress message (worker → main)
Sent every 5 000 candidates. Contains `checked`, `feasible`, and the worker's current top-5 item name lists (not full objects, to minimise clone cost).

### Done message (worker → main)
Sent when a partition finishes. Contains final `checked`, `feasible`, and `top5`. The main thread calls `_on_partition_done`, which accumulates the results and dispatches the next partition from the queue (work-stealing).

---

## Step 6 — Level-Based Enumeration in the Worker (`_run_level_enum`)

### Setup (one-time per partition)

1. **Running statMap** — a `Map` pre-loaded with level base HP and the fixed items (locked equips + tomes + weapon). Free items are added and subtracted from this Map in-place during enumeration, avoiding a full rebuild at every leaf.

2. **Illegal-set tracker** — a lightweight counter that detects when two different items from the same illegal set are simultaneously in the partial build.

3. **Pool ordering** — free armor/accessory slots are sorted ascending by pool size (smallest pool iterated first). This ensures the most-constrained slots are enumerated at shallower recursion depths.

4. **Maximum level** — `L_max = Σ (pool_size[slot] − 1)` over all free armor/accessory slots. This is the highest sum-of-rank-offsets any combination can have.

### Ring iteration (outermost)

Rings are handled outside the main enumeration because both rings draw from the **same pool** and the pair must be unordered (ring1 index ≤ ring2 index). Three cases:

- **Both free** — double loop `i ≤ j`; ring1 = `pool[i]`, ring2 = `pool[j]`. Partition applies to the outer index `i`.
- **One locked** — single loop over the free ring pool.
- **Both locked** — skip ring iteration entirely, fall straight to armor enumeration.

Each ring is placed via `_place_item` (updates running statMap) and removed via `_unplace_item` on backtrack.

### Level-based enumeration over armor/accessory slots (`enumerate(slot_idx, remaining_L)`)

For each level `L` from 0 to `L_max`, `enumerate` assigns rank offsets to free armor/accessory slots such that their sum equals exactly `L`:

- **L = 0**: visits the single combination `(pool[0], pool[0], …, pool[0])` — the globally best build first.
- **L = 1**: visits all combinations with exactly one slot at pool index 1 and all others at 0.
- **L = k**: visits all combinations where the sum of per-slot pool indices equals k.

This ordering guarantees the strongest builds (closest to the top of every pool) are evaluated early. No heap or visited set is needed — memory is O(k) where k is the number of free slots.

**Last-slot constraint:** when `slot_idx == N_free − 1`, the item is placed at exactly `offset = remaining_L` (not `0..remaining_L`). This ensures each combination is visited at exactly one level, preventing duplicate evaluations.

For each item at each slot:
1. **Illegal-set check** — skip if the tracker reports a conflict with an already-placed item.
2. **Place** — `_place_item` updates `running_sm`.
3. **Recurse** — `enumerate(slot_idx + 1, remaining_L − offset)`.
4. **Backtrack** — `_unplace_item` restores `running_sm`.

---

## Step 7 — Leaf Evaluation (`_evaluate_leaf`)

Reached when all free armor/accessory slots have been filled. Five gates before scoring:

### Gate 0: Fast constraint precheck (`_fast_constraint_precheck`, `_fast_ehp_precheck`)
Runs before any SP work. For each `≥` restriction on a simple additive stat (e.g. `mr ≥ 10`, `hprRaw ≥ 200`), checks `running_sm.get(stat) ≥ adjusted_threshold` where `adjusted_threshold = user_threshold − fixed_contributions` (precomputed once at worker init from `atree_raw + static_boosts`). This is a conservative lower bound — it ignores radiance boost, atree scaling, and set bonuses, all of which can only increase the stat. Skills (`str`…`agi`) and `ehp` are excluded from the simple check.

For EHP constraints, an optimistic upper bound is computed: `totalHp / ehp_divisor` where `totalHp` comes from `running_sm` + fixed HP contributions, and `ehp_divisor` is precomputed assuming max def/agi skill points (100 each) and no extra `defMult` penalties. If even this generous estimate falls short, the candidate is rejected.

Both checks use only precomputed constants + a single Map lookup per constraint, making them essentially free compared to the gates that follow.

### Gate 1: Quick SP pre-filter (`_sp_prefilter`)
An O(1) sanity check (no `calculate_skillpoints` call yet). For each attribute, computes `max_req − sum_prov` across all 9 items. If any attribute's net deficit > 100 or the total > `sp_budget`, reject immediately.

### Gate 2: Full SP feasibility (`calculate_skillpoints`)
Calls the recursive backtracking solver that respects Wynncraft's SP assignment rules. Returns `[base_sp, total_sp, assigned_sp, activeSetCounts]`. If `assigned_sp > sp_budget`, reject.

### Stat assembly (`_finalize_leaf_statmap`)
Finalises the running statMap by:
1. Applying set bonuses for active sets (non-SP bonuses only).
2. Setting up `damMult`, `defMult`, `healMult` maps.
3. Collecting `majorIds` from all items.

Then `_assemble_combo_stats` layers on top:
1. Inject `total_sp` values and `classDef` multiplier.
2. Merge `atree_raw` stats.
3. Apply radiance scaling (multiplies positive values of ~70 affected stat IDs).
4. Run `worker_atree_scaling` to apply conditional/slider-driven atree bonuses.
5. Merge atree-scaling stats and static boosts (for threshold checking).

### Gate 3: Stat thresholds (full)
If the user set any restrictions (e.g. "EHP ≥ 50000", "hprRaw ≥ 200"), the fully assembled stats are checked. EHP is computed via `getDefenseStats`. Any violation rejects the candidate. (Gate 0 is a cheap pre-filter; this gate is the authoritative check using final stat values including radiance, atree scaling, set bonuses, and actual skill points.)

### Gate 4: Mana constraint (`_eval_combo_mana_check`)
Only active when `combo_time > 0`. Computes starting mana (100 + item mana + Int bonus), total spell cost (sum of `getSpellCost × qty` for rows not marked `mana_excl`), and mana regen over the combo time. If `allow_downtime` is false, the build is rejected when `start_mana − end_mana > 5` (mana deficit too high for sustainability). If `allow_downtime` is true, the build is rejected only if `end_mana ≤ 0`.

### Scoring (`_eval_score`)
Dispatches to the appropriate objective based on the snapshot's `scoring_target`:
- **`combo_damage`** (default): for each combo row not marked `dmg_excl`, applies boost tokens via `apply_combo_row_boosts`, applies spell property overrides via `apply_spell_prop_overrides`, then calls `computeSpellDisplayAvg` (which calls `calculateSpellDamage` internally and blends normal/crit by dexterity crit chance). Multiplies by quantity and sums.
- **`total_healing`**: same row loop but calls `computeSpellHealingTotal` for each row.
- **`ehp`**: reads EHP (agility-weighted) from `getDefenseStats(thresh_stats)[1][0]`.
- **`spd`, `poison`, `lb`, `xpb`**: reads the named stat directly from `thresh_stats`.

The total is the candidate's **score**.

### Top-5 heap
If the score beats the current 5th-best, the candidate is inserted and the list is re-sorted. Only item names are stored (not full statMaps) to minimise memory.

---

## Step 8 — Result Aggregation (main thread)

### Interim updates (every 5 seconds)
The main thread's progress timer checks each worker's latest `_cur_top5` (from the most recent progress message) and each worker's cumulative `top5` (from completed partitions). These are merged into a global top-5, the best build is loaded into the UI via `_fill_build_into_ui`, and the results panel is refreshed.

### Final merge (`_on_all_workers_done`)
When `active_count` drops to zero (all partitions finished):
1. Aggregate `checked` and `feasible` counts from all workers.
2. Merge top-5 from all workers' cumulative lists.
3. Reconstruct full `Item` objects from stored names (via `itemMap`).
4. Load the best build into the UI; display the ranked results panel.
5. Show a summary line (count, feasible, elapsed time).

### Result panel
Each of the top-5 results is shown as a clickable row. Clicking calls `_fill_build_into_ui` with that result. A new-tab link opens a URL whose hash encodes the full item set.

## Key Optimisations

| Technique | Where | Effect |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Level-based enumeration | `_run_level_enum` | Evaluates the globally best build (L=0) first; each subsequent level is one rank-step further from optimal, so strong builds surface in interim results early |
| Item priority scoring | `_prioritize_pools` + `_build_dmg_weights` | Pools pre-sorted by damage/constraint relevance before search; top of each pool is the highest-priority item |
| Incremental statMap | `_init_running_statmap` + `_incr_add/remove_item` | Avoids full stat rebuild at every leaf |
| Leaf SP pre-filter | `_sp_prefilter` before `calculate_skillpoints` | Rejects infeasible combos before expensive solver call |
| Pool sort (smallest first) | `free_armor_slots.sort(...)` | Visits slots with fewer choices first |
| Work-stealing partitions | 4× worker count | Keeps all cores busy even when partition sizes are unequal |
| Illegal-set tracker | `_make_illegal_tracker()` | O(1) check per item for set-conflict rejection |
| Triangular ring partitioning | `_partition_work` | Equal work distribution for the (i,j) ring double-loop |
| Dominance pruning | `_prune_dominated_items` | Removes items dominated on all scoring stats + SP reqs/provisions before search; shrinks pools without losing optimality (set-bonus interactions not modelled) |
| Fast constraint precheck | `_fast_constraint_precheck` + `_fast_ehp_precheck` | Rejects leaves that can't meet `≥` stat thresholds using only the incremental running statMap + precomputed fixed offsets, before any SP or stat assembly work |

---

## Key Weaknesses

### Score-blind enumeration
The level-based enumeration visits combinations in order of sum-of-rank-offsets (best-first within each level), but it has no branch-and-bound pruning based on the current best score. Every combination at every level is fully evaluated — there is no early exit when remaining levels cannot possibly produce a better result. This means the search remains exhaustive, just with a better visitation order. Interim results are much stronger than before (L=0 is evaluated first), but the total work is unchanged.

### `calculate_skillpoints` called at every feasible leaf
Even when the running incremental SP state already shows `sum_prov[i] ≥ max_req[i]` for every attribute — meaning no manual SP assignment is needed — the full recursive backtracking solver is still invoked. This is the most expensive single call per leaf. A fast-path that skips it when provably unnecessary was designed but deferred because `sum_prov ≥ max_req` is necessary but not sufficient for zero-assignment (Wynncraft's equipping order adds further constraints).

### Ring slots are special-cased throughout
Because both rings draw from the same pool and the pair is unordered, rings are handled with a separate double-loop outside the generic `dfs()` function. This creates three code paths (both free, one free, both locked) and complicates partitioning. Armor slots benefit from the generic slot-ordering optimisation; rings cannot be trivially slotted into it.

---

## High priority improvements

### Intelligent priority scoring
Order items by whatever is needed most in the build, focusing on fulfilling constraints first
i.e. (target ehp - current ehp) / current ehp vs (target MR - current MR) / current MR

### Tune item pool ordering
Develop a testing suite for `_build_dmg_weights` in `solver_search.js`.

---

## Potential Improvements

### Fruma skillpoint changes are goated
Period.

### Integrate rings into generic slot ordering
Move ring iteration into the main `enumerate()` loop (treating rings as a single "ring pair" slot with a pool of `(i, j)` pairs). This would unify the three ring-case code paths, allow rings to participate in the smallest-first slot ordering and level-based enumeration, and simplify partitioning. The `i ≤ j` constraint and pool-level duplicate filtering would need to be encoded in the pair pool.

### Weighted multi-objective scoring
Replace the single combo-damage score with a weighted sum of multiple objectives: `w₁ × damage + w₂ × EHP + w₃ × mana_sustain + ...`. Users specify weights. This makes the solver useful for tank, support, or hybrid builds without changing the search algorithm — only the leaf scoring function changes.

### Tome optimisation
Tomes are currently fixed inputs (user-specified). Including tomes in the search space would require expanding the pool to ~7 additional slots (each with their own item pool), multiplying the search space significantly. A separate inner loop or a post-pass heuristic (swap tomes given a fixed armor build) would be more tractable than a full joint search.

### GPU parallelisation
Each leaf evaluation is independent and the scoring function (combo damage calc) is a fixed arithmetic pipeline. This is structurally suited to GPU compute (WebGPU). The main blocker is that the SP feasibility check (`calculate_skillpoints`) is a recursive backtracking solver that is hard to vectorise; it would need to be replaced with a parallel-friendly formulation (e.g., an LP relaxation or a lookup table) before GPU acceleration is practical.
